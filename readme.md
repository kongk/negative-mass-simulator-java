This project is currently a work-in-progress.

It is java port of the project 
https://github.com/jamiefarnes/negative-mass-simulator


but with some modifications in the simulation algorithm which results in significant lower memory usage.

Also the viewer part is different, as a 3D viewer is used instead of images and video.

Iteration times seems to be somewhat faster than that of the original python program, especially for 50000+ particles.

Initial invocations seems to confirm the findings in the original program.
